Website Leveraging the _Art Institute of Chicago's Public API_
==========

This website is designed to replicate a visitor's experience at the Art Institute of Chicago (AIC).
When walking through the AIC, different artworks of different sizes can be found, therefore you'll
find that all images on this website are of different sizes, too. You can find images based on what
you're looking for . . . do you want to see Picasso's works? Well, simply search 'Picasso' in the 
search bar, and you'll find all artifacts where the API's metadata has any mention of him. The frontend
design of this website is simplistic so you can admire all of the museum's public data from the comfort
of your own home.
